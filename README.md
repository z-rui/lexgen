# lexgen

Lexgen is a lexer generator tool for Go, which mimics the functionality of POSIX `lex`.

## Usage

Specify the lex rules in the following format:
```
prologue
%%
defs
%%
rules
```

Prologue is copied verbatim (which should usually start with a `package` statement),
except that some imports may be inserted.

The defs and rules sections are almost identical to POSIX lex.
The following features are supported:
* `%s` and `%x`
* Start conditions, `BEGIN`.
* `yymore`, `yyless`, `yytext` (note: `yytext` is `[]byte`).

## Lexer interface

The generated lexer exposes a method `Lex(yylval *yySymType) int`.
The user should define `yySymType` (usually it is generated by the parser
generator) to hold the semantic value of a token.
The return value indicates the "major" value of the token.
